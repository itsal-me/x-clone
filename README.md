# X HomePage Clone

This project is a **clone of the X (formerly Twitter) homepage**, focused on the **desktop version**. Currently, this clone is designed without media queries or responsive features. The primary goal of this project is to replicate the look and feel of the X homepage for desktop users.

## Features

- **Static Clone:** This version is static and does not include functionality such as authentication, posts, or other interactive elements.
- **CSS Styling:** Basic CSS has been applied to achieve the desktop appearance. No media queries or responsive design techniques are included at this stage.
